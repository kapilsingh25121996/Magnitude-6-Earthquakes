# Magnitude-6-Earthquakes

This project contains the visualization done on the past Earthquakes records through Power BI.

Data set contains the following features -

1) Timezone when earthquake occurs.

2) Latitude & Longitude coordinates of the earthquake.
3) Depth - It shows how much deep inside the earth crust the earthquake started.
4) Mag - Magnitude of the earthquake.
5) Mag Type - mb, mj, ms, Mt, Mw, mwb, mwc, mwp, mwr, mww, uk
6) Nst - Number of seismic stations which reported P- and S-arrival times for this earthquake. P waves travel fastest and are the first to arrive from the earthquake. In S or shear waves, rock oscillates perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.
7) Gap - In seismology, the term "gap" refers to a section of a fault that has not experienced a large earthquake in a significant amount of time. It is believed that seismic energy accumulates in these areas, making them more prone to experience a large earthquake in the future.
8) dmin - Refers to the minimum distance between a seismic station and the epicenter of an earthquake. The term "dmin" is derived from "minimum distance."
9) rms - stands for root mean square, which is a mathematical method used to measure the amplitude of seismic waves.
10) net - A seismic network is a collection of seismometers and other seismic monitoring instruments that are used to detect and record earthquakes in a particular region.
11) place - Location of earthquake

With the help data we have created an interactive dashboard which shows the insights of the data.

12) In this dashboard we can filter the data based on Magnitude and Year of occurance of earthquake, also we can filter the visualization based of mag type.
13) We have plotted the earthquake locations on a world map which shows the average magnitude of earthquake in those locations.
14) Dashboard also shows the average magnitude and average depth of the earthquake based of the filters we apply.
15) A pie chart has been plotted which shows the count of the top 5 magnitude type.
16) Also there is plot which shows how the count of earthquake have increased over the years.


These are the few visualization we did on the dataset.
